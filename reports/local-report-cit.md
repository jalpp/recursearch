Muluneh, M.G. Impact of climate change on biodiversity and food security: a global perspective—a review article.
Climate change threatens global food security by reducing crop yields, increasing pests and diseases, and altering weather patterns. It also impacts livestock through feed availability and health issues. The World Bank supports climate-smart agriculture to enhance resilience and productivity.
Exploring the dynamics of climate-smart agricultural practices for sustainable resilience in a changing climate - ScienceDirect Exploring the dynamics of climate-smart agricultural practices for sustainable resilience in a changing climate CSA is crucial for enhancing agricultural resilience and mitigating climate change impacts. In this paper, we focused on the determinants influencing the adoption of practices against climate change, such as CSA, and assessed their subsequent impact on the agricultural domain. Here, we have shown that the adoption of CSA practices by farmers leads to notable improvements in crop yields, improves farmer income levels, optimizes resource utilization efficiency, reduces greenhouse gas emissions and increases resilience against the implications of climate change.

Integrating biodiversity conservation into climate-smart agriculture enhances food system resilience, boosts crop yields, and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. This approach improves resource efficiency and supports sustainable livelihoods.
Farmers adopting multiple complementary strategies under climate-smart agriculture help to build highly resilient and sustainable agriculture systems that can respond to shocks associated with
Biodiversity conservation strategies in climate-smart agriculture boost farmer adoption rates through improved crop yields and resilience. Policy development supports sustainable agricultural resilience by promoting these practices. Effective extension services and education are key to higher adoption rates.
Key findings from this special issue include: (1) the variables, including age, gender, education, risk perception and preferences, access to credit, farm size, production conditions, off-farm income, and labour allocation, have a mixed (either positive or negative) influence on the adoption of CSA practices; (2) the variables, including labour endowment, land tenure security, access to extension services, agricultural training, membership in farmers’ organizations, support from non-governmental organizations, climate conditions, and access to information consistently have a positive impact on CSA adoption; (3) diverse forms of capital (physical, social, human, financial, natural, and institutional), social responsibility awareness, and digital advisory services can effectively promote CSA adoption; (4) the establishment of climate-smart villages and civil-society organizations enhances CSA adoption by improving their access to credit; (5) CSA adoption contributes to improved farm resilience to climate change and mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions; (6) CSA adoption leads to higher crop yields, increased farm income, and greater economic diversification; (7) integrating CSA technologies into traditional agricultural practices not only boosts economic viability but also contributes to environmental sustainability and health benefits; and (8) there is a critical need for international collaboration in transferring technology for CSA.

Socio-economic factors like age, gender, education, and access to credit influence the adoption and success of biodiversity conservation strategies in climate-smart agriculture. Education and credit access often positively impact adoption rates. Gender and age can affect willingness and ability to adopt new practices.

 **Statistics** 
 As of March 17, 2025, 65% of global food systems that have integrated biodiversity conservation strategies into climate-smart agriculture practices report increased resilience to climate change impacts. ([WWF](https://wwfint.awsassets.panda.org/downloads/biodiversity-and-climate-action-in-agriculture-and-food-systems.pdf))
As of March 17, 2025, approximately 90% of farmers who have adopted climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices report positive outcomes, including improved income and food access ([MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/18/11370)). Specific percentages of adoption vary by region; for instance, 96.2% of farmers in certain areas have adopted conservation agriculture as a primary CSA practice ([Wiley](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/fes3.70021)). 

The adoption of these strategies has influenced policy development by prompting governments to create supportive environments through incentives and the removal of barriers, thereby enhancing agricultural resilience ([FAO](https://www.fao.org/climate-smart-agriculture-sourcebook/enabling-frameworks/module-c3-policy/chapter-c3-5/en/)). This synergy between farmer practices and policy initiatives is essential for promoting sustainable agricultural resilience in the face of climate change.
As of March 17, 2025, recent studies indicate that integrating biodiversity conservation strategies within climate-smart agriculture practices has significantly improved economic viability and environmental sustainability for farms in climate-prone regions. A comprehensive analysis incorporating data from 24 studies across 11 countries revealed that farms employing multiple diversification strategies—such as livestock inclusion, crop rotation, and soil conservation—exhibited notable benefits. Specifically, these farms reported enhanced food security and increased nonagricultural biodiversity, with effect sizes indicating substantial positive impacts on both social and environmental outcomes ([Science](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adj1914)).

Furthermore, research shows that areas with higher biodiversity can buffer farmers' incomes against climate-induced shocks, such as droughts, thereby stabilizing their economic conditions. For instance, a study covering over 7,500 households across 23 tropical countries found that farmers in biodiverse regions experienced less income loss during adverse weather events ([Science Daily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/06/190627121246.htm)). This evidence collectively underscores the critical role of biodiversity in enhancing resilience and sustainability in agriculture, particularly in the face of climate change ([Natural Capital Project](https://naturalcapitalproject.stanford.edu/news/farming-against-climate-change)).
No relevant information was found regarding the percentage of individuals involved in climate-smart agriculture reporting successful adoption of biodiversity conservation strategies segmented by socio-economic factors as of March 17, 2025.
As of March 17, 2025, comprehensive data specifically quantifying the percentage of farmers adopting biodiversity conservation strategies within climate-smart agriculture (CSA) segmented by socio-economic factors (age, gender, education) and institutional support mechanisms (access to extension services, membership in farmers' organizations) remains limited. However, recent studies indicate that gender-responsive approaches significantly enhance the adoption of CSA practices among women farmers. For instance, targeted interventions, such as Farmer Field Schools, have shown to increase women's participation and knowledge retention, leading to higher adoption rates of CSA practices ([FAO](https://www.fao.org/climate-smart-agriculture-sourcebook/enabling-frameworks/module-c6-gender/chapter-c6-5/en), [Knowledge dissemination approaches targeting women](https://gender.cgiar.org/news/knowledge-dissemination-approaches-targeting-women-increase-their-use-climate-smart)).

Moreover, socio-economic factors like access to resources and education play critical roles in adoption rates. Studies suggest that farmers with better access to extension services and financial instruments are more likely to engage in CSA practices, although specific percentages segmented by these factors are not consistently reported across studies ([World Bank](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/917051543938012931/pdf/132672-WP-P168692-PUBLIC-4-12-2018-12-27-47-CSAInsightsfromCSAProfiles.pdf), [Improving Climate Resilience through Agriculture](https://navigatingimpact.thegiin.org/strategy/sa/improving-climate-resilience-through-agriculture/)). Further research is needed to quantify these relationships more precisely.
