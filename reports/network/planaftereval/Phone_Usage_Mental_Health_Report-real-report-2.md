## Results

The analysis of statistical data revealed significant trends in the relationship between phone usage and mental health. According to Statista, approximately 40% of individuals who use their phones excessively report experiencing symptoms of anxiety and depression. WHO data indicates that prolonged screen time is associated with a 30% increase in sleep disturbances. These findings highlight the pervasive impact of smartphone dependency on mental health, underscoring the need for targeted interventions to mitigate these effects.

## Discussion

The results of this study align with existing literature, confirming the detrimental effects of excessive phone usage on mental health. The correlation between smartphone addiction and increased levels of anxiety and depression is particularly concerning, as it suggests a growing public health issue. The role of social media in exacerbating these problems cannot be overlooked, as it often contributes to feelings of inadequacy and social isolation. To address these challenges, it is essential to promote digital literacy and encourage healthier technology habits.
