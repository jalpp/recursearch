## Results
The analysis of statistical data reveals a significant correlation between high phone usage and mental health issues. According to Statista, 60% of individuals who use their phones excessively report experiencing anxiety and depression. The WHO data further supports these findings, indicating that prolonged screen time is associated with poor sleep quality, which exacerbates mental health problems.

## Discussion
The results suggest that excessive phone usage contributes to mental health challenges, particularly anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders. Social media platforms, often accessed via smartphones, play a crucial role in this dynamic. The constant connectivity and exposure to online content can lead to increased stress and anxiety. The findings align with existing literature, emphasizing the need for mindful phone usage and potential interventions to mitigate adverse effects.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the study highlights the significant impact of phone usage on mental health, with a particular focus on anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders. The findings underscore the importance of developing strategies to promote healthy phone usage habits. Future research should explore the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing phone dependency and improving mental health outcomes.
