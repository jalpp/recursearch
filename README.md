# üåê RecurSearch

**RecurSearch** is an AI-driven recursive web research tool designed to mimic OpenAI's Deep Research. It can search the web recursively to generate comprehensive research reports with or without citations.

## Features

- **Recursive Web Search**: Perform multi-layered web searches, diving deeper into follow-up questions.
- **AI-Powered Agents**: Specialized agents for generating, validating, and picking research questions and web content.
- **Stats support**: the reports are backed by stats 
- **Images:** the reports contain related research focused searched images
- **Pages:** the report can be generated up to 2 pages
- **Logging** with reports, the local generated copy by all the agents plus log data is kept in local-log and local-report files to explore agents answers
- **Citations Support**: Option to generate research reports with citations.
- **Customizable Depth**: Control the search depth of research.
- **Auto Generated Report**: the reports, logs, and local report are automatically generated locally by agent

## Installation

Ensure you have **Node.js v18+** installed, then add the dependencies:

```bash

cd recursearch
npm i
```

Set up env variables:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
TAVILY_API_KEY=your-tavily-api-key
EXA_API_KEY=your-exa-api-key

```

Run Mastra Dev server to create reports

```
npm run dev

```

Go to search agent and ask it to generate reports.

## Agents
RecurSearch leverages multiple AI agents with distinct roles:

- **Search Agent**
Understands users query to call the searchAgentTool which kicks of MAS, its also responsible understand and format the report to meet user defined requirements.

- **Question Agent:**
Generates thought-provoking follow-up research questions based on content.

- **Custom Question Agent:**
Validates whether a newly generated question is thematically unique or overlaps with existing ones.

- **Question Picker Agent:**
Compares pairs of research questions and selects the most research-focused one.

- **Stats Agent**
Responsible for generating stats question for given running question to support research content by data

- **Image Agent**
Responsible for generating image search query for given running answer, to ensure images are research quality

- **Content Picker Agent:**
Evaluates and picks the most relevant and credible web source from two given options. [When Citations are required]

This Agents collabrate in a team to recursively search the web, and in a decision tree manner pick the best path in the tree to come up with the report.

## Highlevel Overview
can view digrams to understand the flow.

## Examples
the `reports` contain recursearch's reports that were solely generated by the agents and I didn't touch/modify them. There are preview screenshots for proofs. 

The examples include reports on
- The Influence of Chronic Stress on Immune System Function
- Impact of AI-Generated Content on Journalism and Media Credibility
- Impact of Music Therapy on Individuals with Depression

## Use/Terms

this tool was created to research how agents can generate research reports, the tool must not be used unethically, the authors of recursearch take no responsibility in doing so.

Recursearch was inspired by following paper:
