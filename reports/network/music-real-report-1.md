## Introduction

Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder characterized by persistent sadness, loss of interest, and a range of emotional and physical problems. Traditional treatments include medication and psychotherapy, but alternative therapies like music therapy are gaining attention for their potential benefits. Music therapy involves the use of music to address emotional, cognitive, and social needs, offering a non-invasive and enjoyable approach to treatment. This report delves into the specific mechanisms by which music therapy can alleviate symptoms of depression and evaluates how the duration and frequency of sessions influence its effectiveness.

## Mechanisms of Music Therapy

Music therapy alleviates symptoms of depression through several mechanisms. One significant mechanism is anxiety reduction, as music therapy can lower anxiety levels, which are often intertwined with depression, thereby improving overall functionality. Additionally, music therapy activates the brain's reward circuits by synchronizing brain activity with music, which can help reduce depressive symptoms. Research indicates that listening to music significantly reduces acute stress and anxiety, contributing to mood improvement. Furthermore, music therapy enhances communication skills, emotional regulation, and coping mechanisms, which are crucial for managing depression. These mechanisms collectively contribute to the alleviation of depression symptoms in individuals undergoing music therapy.
