**Report: ** 
 Mental health services include assessments, case management, and crisis intervention. Professionals provide support in various settings. Access to services is available through hotlines and local navigators.
Urban and rural areas differ in mental health service accessibility due to fewer providers, transportation issues, and stigma; policy interventions should focus on telehealth, community engagement, and provider incentives.
Policy interventions should enhance telehealth access in rural areas, remove geographic restrictions, and expand provider eligibility to improve mental health care.
Telehealth services can improve healthcare access and quality in rural areas through better patient outcomes and reduced travel barriers. Policy measures include expanding provider eligibility and removing geographic restrictions for telehealth services. These changes ensure equitable access and outcomes for rural communities.
To harmonize telehealth policies across states, adopt uniform licensing, ensure equitable broadband access, and standardize payment for telehealth services.

 **Statistics: ** 
In the United States, individuals in rural areas face significant barriers to accessing mental health services, despite similar rates of mental illness compared to urban areas ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7681156), [Rural Health Information Hub](https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/topics/mental-health)).

Commonly cited factors contributing to these barriers include:
*   **Accessibility:** Rural residents often have to travel long distances for services, and are less likely to have insurance coverage for mental health services ([Rural Health Information Hub](https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/topics/mental-health)).
*   **Availability:** There are chronic shortages of mental health professionals in rural areas ([Rural Health Information Hub](https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/topics/mental-health)).
*   **Affordability:** The cost of mental healthcare, including out-of-pocket expenses, can be a barrier, and rural residents are more likely to be uninsured ([Rural Health Information Hub](https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/topics/mental-health)).
*   **Acceptability:** Stigma surrounding mental health issues and a lack of culturally responsive care can deter individuals from seeking help ([Rural Health Information Hub](https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/topics/mental-health), [SAMHSA Library](https://library.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/sma16-4989.pdf)).

I am sorry, but I cannot answer the question. The provided search results do not contain the specific percentage requested.

While the search results do not provide specific percentages for improved healthcare accessibility and quality in rural areas after telehealth implementation compared to urban areas, they do offer some insights:

*   **Telehealth Interest and Experience:** A survey of 200 rural residents showed predominately positive experiences with telehealth where there was a need and lack of access to healthcare. ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392842))
*   **Telehealth Utilization:** During the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth use increased among both urban and rural Medicaid enrollees. However, by the end of 2021, rural enrollees were using half as many telehealth services as they had been in the second quarter of 2020. Urban enrollees reduced utilization by 41% during the same period.

*   **Rural Health Disparities:** Rural areas often experience poorer health outcomes compared to urban centers due to limited access to specialty services and workforce shortages. Telehealth offers a promising solution by providing access to specialized care without the need for long-distance travel. ([ruralhealth.us](https://www.ruralhealth.us/blogs/2025/02/telehealth-s-impact-on-rural-hospitals-a-literature-review))
*   **Barriers to Access:** Rural residents face barriers to healthcare, including transportation issues and workforce shortages. ([ruralhealthinfo.org](https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/topics/healthcare-access))

I am sorry, but the search results do not contain the specific percentage of rural healthcare providers that report improved patient outcomes after the implementation of harmonized telehealth policies across states.
