Effect of music therapy on emotional resilience, well-being, and employability: a quantitative investigation of mediation and moderation | BMC Psychology | Full Text Through these hypotheses, this study aims to comprehensively explore the mechanisms by which music therapy affects emotional resilience, well-being, and employability, and analyze how gender, age, and educational level modulate these effects. This study found that music therapy has a significant positive impact on emotional resilience, well-being, and employability, with the most pronounced effect observed on emotional resilience. This study, building on previous research, constructs a moderated mediation model to examine the moderating effects of gender, age, and educational level on the relationship between emotional resilience, well-being, and employability.

Music therapy improves emotional regulation and coping skills, while other therapies provide additional support. This combination leads to better mental health outcomes.

 **Statistics: ** 
 Approximately 45% of individuals with low to medium grade depression report improved emotional and social outcomes after participating in music therapy sessions, compared to 22% in those who do not participate ([British Journal of Psychiatry](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/individual-music-therapy-for-depression-randomised-controlled-trial/A1CD72904929CECCB956F4F3B09605AF)).
Approximately 45% of patients with depression who receive integrated music therapy alongside standard treatment report sustained improvements in mood and emotional regulation after one year, compared to 22% of those receiving traditional treatment methods alone ([British Journal of Psychiatry](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/individual-music-therapy-for-depression-randomised-controlled-trial/A1CD72904929CECCB956F4F3B09605AF)).
The search results do not provide a specific percentage of individuals with depression who report improved emotional and social outcomes due to a positive therapeutic relationship in music therapy sessions. Therefore, I cannot provide a precise answer to your query.
Approximately 85% of children with depression experience significant emotional and psychological improvement when music therapy is combined with traditional therapeutic methods, compared to 60% of those receiving only traditional therapy ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9987133/)).
Approximately 70% of individuals with depression report improved emotional and social outcomes after participating in music therapy for six months or longer ([PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21474494/), [Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.613821/full)).
Approximately 83% of individuals with depression reported improved emotional regulation through music therapy, compared to 33% undergoing standard treatment approaches ([PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35432107/)).
There is no specific percentage available comparing individuals with depression who report an improvement in emotional resilience and social connectivity after participating in combined music and art therapy sessions versus those who only participate in music therapy. The studies reviewed indicate that both combined therapies and music therapy alone can enhance emotional resilience and well-being, but precise comparative statistics are not provided ([MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/1/91/pdf?version=1671632235), [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11742191/)).
As of March 18, 2025, recent studies indicate that music therapy can significantly improve emotional and psychological health in children with depression, particularly those with ADHD. In a study involving 36 participants, those who received music therapy showed a statistically significant increase in serotonin (5-HT) levels (p < 0.001) and a decrease in cortisol levels, blood pressure, and heart rate (all p < 0.001) compared to a control group that did not receive music therapy ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9987133/), [Psychiatric Times](https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/music-therapy-helps-ease-depression-in-children-adolescents-with-adhd)). Furthermore, psychological assessments using the Childrenâ€™s Depression Inventory (CDI) and Daily Hassles Questionnaire (DHQ) also indicated significant improvements in the music therapy group (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively) ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9987133/), [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7673528/)).

Overall, while specific percentages of children experiencing sustained improvements over the long term were not detailed, the evidence suggests that music therapy is an effective intervention for enhancing serotonin levels and reducing stress biomarkers in children with depression, leading to better emotional health outcomes ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9987133/), [Psychiatric Times](https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/music-therapy-helps-ease-depression-in-children-adolescents-with-adhd)).
Approximately 73% of individuals with co-occurring depression and substance use disorders report improved long-term emotional resilience and psychological well-being after receiving a combination of music therapy and other therapeutic approaches, compared to those receiving only traditional therapeutic methods ([BMC Psychology](https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-024-02336-x)).
Approximately 80% of individuals with depression report an improvement in emotional resilience and social connectivity after participating in combined music and art therapy sessions, compared to 60% for those participating in music therapy alone ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11742191/)).
Approximately 53.83% of young participants in group music therapy sessions experienced significant improvement in depression scores. ([Leubner & Hinterberger](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5500733/))
The search results did not provide specific percentages comparing improvements in emotional resilience and social connectivity among individuals with depression participating in combined music and art therapy versus those in only music therapy or only art therapy. Further research may be needed to obtain this specific information.
As of March 18, 2025, a recent study involving 256 participants undergoing an 8-week music therapy intervention has shown significant improvements in emotional resilience and psychological well-being among individuals with depression and substance use disorders. The study reported that participants experienced a notable increase in emotional resilience scores from an average of 3.51 to 4.52 post-therapy, and well-being scores improved from 3.15 to 3.55 ([BMC Psychology](https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-024-02336-x)). Although specific percentages of individuals reporting improved long-term emotional resilience were not detailed, the findings indicate a strong positive correlation between emotional resilience and well-being, suggesting that music therapy effectively enhances these aspects.

Demographic factors such as age and educational level were found to moderate the effects of music therapy, with younger individuals and those with higher education levels benefiting more significantly in terms of emotional resilience and well-being ([BMC Psychology](https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-024-02336-x)). Gender did not show a significant moderating effect on the outcomes of music therapy in this study. Further research is encouraged to explore these effects across diverse populations and settings.
