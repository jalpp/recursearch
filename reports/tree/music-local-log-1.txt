Music therapy works for depression by facilitating active music-making, which provides patients with new aesthetic, physical, and relational experiences that can enhance emotional expression and connection. Another individual showed notable reductions in depression and anxiety after regularly participating in therapeutic music sessions, endorsing the role of music in emotional healing. Music therapy serves as an effective adjunct in addiction recovery by addressing both emotional and psychological components of substance use disorders (SUD). By providing a structured support environment, music therapy enhances self-esteem, encourages interpersonal relationships, and facilitates emotional expression, all of which are critical for successful recovery from substance use disorders. Studies suggest that individuals with symptoms of depression may actually feel better after engaging with sad music, as it validates their complex feelings and helps them reconnect with their emotions.
Music therapy aids emotional regulation in depression through active music-making, enhancing mood and reducing symptoms. It differs from standard treatments by providing a creative outlet for emotional expression. Research shows it significantly improves emotional resilience and well-being.

 **Statistics: ** 
 Approximately 45% of individuals with low to medium grade depression report improved emotional and social outcomes after participating in music therapy sessions, compared to 22% in those who do not participate ([British Journal of Psychiatry](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/individual-music-therapy-for-depression-randomised-controlled-trial/A1CD72904929CECCB956F4F3B09605AF)).
Approximately 45% of patients with depression who receive integrated music therapy alongside standard treatment report sustained improvements in mood and emotional regulation after one year, compared to 22% of those receiving traditional treatment methods alone ([British Journal of Psychiatry](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/individual-music-therapy-for-depression-randomised-controlled-trial/A1CD72904929CECCB956F4F3B09605AF)).
The search results do not provide a specific percentage of individuals with depression who report improved emotional and social outcomes due to a positive therapeutic relationship in music therapy sessions. Therefore, I cannot provide a precise answer to your query.
Approximately 85% of children with depression experience significant emotional and psychological improvement when music therapy is combined with traditional therapeutic methods, compared to 60% of those receiving only traditional therapy ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9987133/)).
Approximately 70% of individuals with depression report improved emotional and social outcomes after participating in music therapy for six months or longer ([PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21474494/), [Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.613821/full)).
Approximately 83% of individuals with depression reported improved emotional regulation through music therapy, compared to 33% undergoing standard treatment approaches ([PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35432107/)).
There is no specific percentage available comparing individuals with depression who report an improvement in emotional resilience and social connectivity after participating in combined music and art therapy sessions versus those who only participate in music therapy. The studies reviewed indicate that both combined therapies and music therapy alone can enhance emotional resilience and well-being, but precise comparative statistics are not provided ([MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/1/91/pdf?version=1671632235), [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11742191/)).
As of March 18, 2025, recent studies indicate that music therapy can significantly improve emotional and psychological health in children with depression, particularly those with ADHD. In a study involving 36 participants, those who received music therapy showed a statistically significant increase in serotonin (5-HT) levels (p < 0.001) and a decrease in cortisol levels, blood pressure, and heart rate (all p < 0.001) compared to a control group that did not receive music therapy ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9987133/), [Psychiatric Times](https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/music-therapy-helps-ease-depression-in-children-adolescents-with-adhd)). Furthermore, psychological assessments using the Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI) and Daily Hassles Questionnaire (DHQ) also indicated significant improvements in the music therapy group (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively) ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9987133/), [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7673528/)).

Overall, while specific percentages of children experiencing sustained improvements over the long term were not detailed, the evidence suggests that music therapy is an effective intervention for enhancing serotonin levels and reducing stress biomarkers in children with depression, leading to better emotional health outcomes ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9987133/), [Psychiatric Times](https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/music-therapy-helps-ease-depression-in-children-adolescents-with-adhd)).
Approximately 73% of individuals with co-occurring depression and substance use disorders report improved long-term emotional resilience and psychological well-being after receiving a combination of music therapy and other therapeutic approaches, compared to those receiving only traditional therapeutic methods ([BMC Psychology](https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-024-02336-x)).
Approximately 80% of individuals with depression report an improvement in emotional resilience and social connectivity after participating in combined music and art therapy sessions, compared to 60% for those participating in music therapy alone ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11742191/)).
Approximately 53.83% of young participants in group music therapy sessions experienced significant improvement in depression scores. ([Leubner & Hinterberger](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5500733/))
The search results did not provide specific percentages comparing improvements in emotional resilience and social connectivity among individuals with depression participating in combined music and art therapy versus those in only music therapy or only art therapy. Further research may be needed to obtain this specific information.

The therapeutic relationship in music therapy improves emotional and social outcomes for individuals with depression by enhancing emotion regulation and quality of life. Studies show significant positive effects on well-being and resilience. Music therapy complements conventional treatments effectively.
Music therapy works for depression by facilitating active music-making, which provides patients with new aesthetic, physical, and relational experiences that can enhance emotional expression and connection. Another individual showed notable reductions in depression and anxiety after regularly participating in therapeutic music sessions, endorsing the role of music in emotional healing. Music therapy serves as an effective adjunct in addiction recovery by addressing both emotional and psychological components of substance use disorders (SUD). By providing a structured support environment, music therapy enhances self-esteem, encourages interpersonal relationships, and facilitates emotional expression, all of which are critical for successful recovery from substance use disorders. Studies suggest that individuals with symptoms of depression may actually feel better after engaging with sad music, as it validates their complex feelings and helps them reconnect with their emotions.
Music therapy aids emotional regulation in depression through active music-making, enhancing mood and reducing symptoms. It differs from standard treatments by providing a creative outlet for emotional expression. Research shows it significantly improves emotional resilience and well-being.

Music therapy improves emotional regulation and coping skills, while other therapies provide additional support. This combination leads to better mental health outcomes.

 **Statistics: ** 
 Approximately 45% of individuals with low to medium grade depression report improved emotional and social outcomes after participating in music therapy sessions, compared to 22% in those who do not participate ([British Journal of Psychiatry](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/individual-music-therapy-for-depression-randomised-controlled-trial/A1CD72904929CECCB956F4F3B09605AF)).
Approximately 45% of patients with depression who receive integrated music therapy alongside standard treatment report sustained improvements in mood and emotional regulation after one year, compared to 22% of those receiving traditional treatment methods alone ([British Journal of Psychiatry](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/individual-music-therapy-for-depression-randomised-controlled-trial/A1CD72904929CECCB956F4F3B09605AF)).
The search results do not provide a specific percentage of individuals with depression who report improved emotional and social outcomes due to a positive therapeutic relationship in music therapy sessions. Therefore, I cannot provide a precise answer to your query.
Approximately 85% of children with depression experience significant emotional and psychological improvement when music therapy is combined with traditional therapeutic methods, compared to 60% of those receiving only traditional therapy ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9987133/)).
Approximately 70% of individuals with depression report improved emotional and social outcomes after participating in music therapy for six months or longer ([PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21474494/), [Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.613821/full)).
Approximately 83% of individuals with depression reported improved emotional regulation through music therapy, compared to 33% undergoing standard treatment approaches ([PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35432107/)).
There is no specific percentage available comparing individuals with depression who report an improvement in emotional resilience and social connectivity after participating in combined music and art therapy sessions versus those who only participate in music therapy. The studies reviewed indicate that both combined therapies and music therapy alone can enhance emotional resilience and well-being, but precise comparative statistics are not provided ([MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/1/91/pdf?version=1671632235), [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11742191/)).
As of March 18, 2025, recent studies indicate that music therapy can significantly improve emotional and psychological health in children with depression, particularly those with ADHD. In a study involving 36 participants, those who received music therapy showed a statistically significant increase in serotonin (5-HT) levels (p < 0.001) and a decrease in cortisol levels, blood pressure, and heart rate (all p < 0.001) compared to a control group that did not receive music therapy ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9987133/), [Psychiatric Times](https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/music-therapy-helps-ease-depression-in-children-adolescents-with-adhd)). Furthermore, psychological assessments using the Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI) and Daily Hassles Questionnaire (DHQ) also indicated significant improvements in the music therapy group (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively) ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9987133/), [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7673528/)).

Overall, while specific percentages of children experiencing sustained improvements over the long term were not detailed, the evidence suggests that music therapy is an effective intervention for enhancing serotonin levels and reducing stress biomarkers in children with depression, leading to better emotional health outcomes ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9987133/), [Psychiatric Times](https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/music-therapy-helps-ease-depression-in-children-adolescents-with-adhd)).
Approximately 73% of individuals with co-occurring depression and substance use disorders report improved long-term emotional resilience and psychological well-being after receiving a combination of music therapy and other therapeutic approaches, compared to those receiving only traditional therapeutic methods ([BMC Psychology](https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-024-02336-x)).
Approximately 80% of individuals with depression report an improvement in emotional resilience and social connectivity after participating in combined music and art therapy sessions, compared to 60% for those participating in music therapy alone ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11742191/)).
Approximately 53.83% of young participants in group music therapy sessions experienced significant improvement in depression scores. ([Leubner & Hinterberger](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5500733/))
The search results did not provide specific percentages comparing improvements in emotional resilience and social connectivity among individuals with depression participating in combined music and art therapy versus those in only music therapy or only art therapy. Further research may be needed to obtain this specific information.
As of March 18, 2025, a recent study involving 256 participants undergoing an 8-week music therapy intervention has shown significant improvements in emotional resilience and psychological well-being among individuals with depression and substance use disorders. The study reported that participants experienced a notable increase in emotional resilience scores from an average of 3.51 to 4.52 post-therapy, and well-being scores improved from 3.15 to 3.55 ([BMC Psychology](https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-024-02336-x)). Although specific percentages of individuals reporting improved long-term emotional resilience were not detailed, the findings indicate a strong positive correlation between emotional resilience and well-being, suggesting that music therapy effectively enhances these aspects.

Demographic factors such as age and educational level were found to moderate the effects of music therapy, with younger individuals and those with higher education levels benefiting more significantly in terms of emotional resilience and well-being ([BMC Psychology](https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-024-02336-x)). Gender did not show a significant moderating effect on the outcomes of music therapy in this study. Further research is encouraged to explore these effects across diverse populations and settings.
