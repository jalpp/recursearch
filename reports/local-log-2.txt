The adaptation of copyright laws across different jurisdictions often leads to conflicts due to varying interpretations of authorship and ownership, particularly concerning AI-generated content. The report highlights that copyright protection is contingent on the level of human contribution, with purely AI-generated outputs lacking eligibility for copyright. This has resulted in diverse legal interpretations globally, which can create tension between jurisdictions that may have different thresholds for what constitutes sufficient human involvement in creative works ([RAND](https://www.rand.org/pubs/perspectives/PEA3243-1.html), [Manatt](https://www.manatt.com/insights/newsletters/copyright-office-releases-new-report-on-copyrightability-of-ai-works)).
As of March 18, 2025, there is no specific percentage reported regarding how many international coalitions among artists, rights organizations, and policymakers have successfully implemented global licensing frameworks to ensure fair compensation and recognition for human artists in response to AI-generated music. However, significant advocacy efforts are underway across various regions. For instance, the Human Artistry Campaign, which includes a broad coalition of groups representing over 6 million creators, emphasizes the need for fair licensing practices and the protection of artists' rights in the face of AI advancements ([CISAC](https://www.cisac.org/Newsroom/articles-lobbying/global-creators-and-performers-demand-creative-rights-ai-proliferation), [GJIA](https://gjia.georgetown.edu/2024/07/10/innovation-and-artists-rights-in-the-age-of-generative-ai/)).

Various legislative proposals, such as the Generative AI Copyright Disclosure Act in the U.S. and similar initiatives in the EU and other regions, aim to address these issues, but comprehensive global frameworks are still in development. The complexity of copyright laws and the rapidly evolving nature of AI technology pose challenges for achieving widespread agreement on effective solutions ([CISAC](https://www.cisac.org/Newsroom/news-releases/global-economic-study-shows-human-creators-future-risk-generative-ai), [Recording Academy](https://www.recordingacademy.com/advocacy/news/ai-copyright-protecting-music-creators-united-states-copyright-office)).
