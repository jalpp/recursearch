**Report: ** 
 These sophisticated models, powered by deep learning techniques and trained on vast amounts of text data, have emerged as veritable game-changers in understanding and generating human-like language. Large Language Models (LLMs) are a subset of machine learning models that have the capacity to understand, interpret, and generate human-like text based on the input they receive. Large Language Models (LLMs), such as those based on the Transformer architecture, have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) with their ability to understand and generate human-like text. Pre-training equips the language model with a broad understanding of language and general knowledge, much like a student learning to write by reading widely.

arXiv:2502.10708 arXiv author ID Injecting Domain-Specific Knowledge into Large Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in various tasks such as natural language understanding, text summarization, and machine translation. To address this, researchers have explored diverse methods to enhance LLMs by integrating domain-specific knowledge. We discuss how these methods enable LLMs to tackle specialized tasks, compare their advantages and disadvantages, evaluate domain-specific LLMs against general LLMs, and highlight the challenges and opportunities in this emerging field.

Effective approaches include dynamic knowledge injection, static knowledge embedding, modular adapters, and prompt optimization. These methods are compared based on reliability and validity through benchmarks and specialized datasets. The most effective approach depends on the specific domain and task.

 **Statistics: ** 
 I am sorry, but the provided search results do not contain the specific percentage of Large Language Models (LLMs) that have integrated domain-specific knowledge and demonstrate improved performance metrics. Therefore, I am unable to answer your question.

When domain-specific knowledge is integrated into large language models (LLMs), the percentage of accurate responses can increase significantly. For example, the integration of a Retrieval-augmented Information System for Enhancement (RISE) framework improved the accuracy of responses from three base LLMs by an average of 12% ([jmir.org](https://www.jmir.org/2024/1/e58041/)). Specifically, the rates of accurate responses increased by 7% for GPT-4, 19% for Claude 2, and 9% for Google Bard ([jmir.org](https://www.jmir.org/2024/1/e58041/)).

I am sorry, but I am unable to answer your question. The search results do not contain the specific percentage of studies that report statistically significant improvements in large language models when domain-specific knowledge integration is applied.

I am sorry, but the search results do not provide the specific percentage of Large Language Models (LLMs) with integrated domain-specific knowledge that demonstrate improved performance in specialized fields compared to those without such knowledge. Therefore, I am unable to answer your question.

I am sorry, but the provided search results do not contain the specific percentage of performance improvement observed in large language models with domain-specific knowledge integration compared to general language models on specialized tasks. Therefore, I am unable to answer your question.
