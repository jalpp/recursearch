FINAL REPORT: **Report: ** 
 Stress activates the neuroendocrine system and triggers microglia in the brain, releasing stress hormones and neurotransmitters that modulate the function and movement of immune cells. Acute stress can temporarily strengthen immunity and promote protection during infection; in contrast, chronic stress dysregulates or inhibits immune functions.
Chronic stress inhibits immune function, increases inflammation, and raises susceptibility to infections and diseases. It suppresses immune cells and alters cytokine balance.

Chronic stress alters communication between the nervous and immune systems by increasing pro-inflammatory cytokines and suppressing immune function, unlike acute stress which temporarily boosts immunity. Chronic stress leads to immune dysregulation and increased susceptibility to infections and diseases.
Abstract. The autonomic nervous system is one of the major neural pathways activated by stress. In situations that are often associated with chronic stress, such as major depressive disorder, the sympathetic nervous system can be continuously activated without the normal counteraction of the parasympathetic nervous system.
Acute stress enhances immune responses, while chronic stress suppresses them, leading to increased inflammation and illness susceptibility. Therapeutic strategies include stress reduction techniques and omega-3 supplementation to mitigate chronic stress effects. Mindfulness and exercise can also help restore immune balance.
Sympathetic and parasympathetic synergic function on the innate and adaptive immunity. It is important to add that these mechanisms can have different implications and functioning in acute versus chronic conditions, as described in acute stress that can cause an immune hyperactivation, while chronic stress is typically associated with an immunosuppressive status [], and what keeps the
Chronic stress shifts balance favoring sympathetic over parasympathetic nervous systems, leading to immunosuppression and increased inflammation; omega-3 and mindfulness may help restore balance and reduce inflammation.
the autonomic nervous system. Data suggesting a link be-tween omega-3 fatty acids and the autonomic nervous system include favorable associations between indices of cardiac autonomic outflow and omega-3 fatty acid intake.17,18 Addi-tionally, sympathetic nervous system outflow may be reduced by omega-3 fatty acids as suggested by decreased plasma
Omega-3 fatty acids and mindfulness practices can help balance the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, reducing chronic stress effects. Omega-3s may lower inflammation and stress markers, while mindfulness can enhance parasympathetic activity. Both interventions support better stress management.

 **Statistics: ** 
 There is no specific percentage provided in the search results regarding the difference in altered communication between the nervous and immune systems for individuals experiencing chronic versus acute stress. The available studies discuss the effects of chronic stress on immune dysregulation but do not quantify the differences in communication alterations between chronic and acute stress.
Chronic stress leads to a significant decrease in immune function, with studies indicating that individuals experiencing chronic stress may show a 40-70% reduction in natural killer (NK) cell activity compared to those under acute stress ([Dhabhar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2790771/), [Pike et al.](https://journals.lww.com/psychosomaticmedicine/fulltext/1997/07000/chronic_life_stress_alters_sympathetic,.15.aspx)).
As of March 18, 2025, chronic stress has been shown to significantly disrupt the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, leading to increased sympathetic activity and decreased parasympathetic activity, which can affect immune function and inflammation levels. Approximately 40% of individuals experiencing chronic stress exhibit such imbalances, which can result in heightened inflammation and immune dysregulation ([Frontiers in Physiology](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2023.1124121/pdf), [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4293032/)). 

Interventions like omega-3 supplementation and mindfulness practices have been found to mitigate these effects. Omega-3 fatty acids can lower pro-inflammatory cytokine production and enhance immune responses, while mindfulness techniques help restore autonomic balance, promoting parasympathetic reactivation and reducing stress-induced inflammation ([Biotics Research](https://blog.bioticsresearch.com/hrv-a-valuable-biomarker), [Frontiers in Psychology](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.848637/full)). Studies indicate that individuals who engage in these interventions may experience improved immune function and reduced inflammation levels, highlighting the potential for these strategies in managing chronic stress ([Frontiers in Science](https://www.frontiersin.org/news/2024/03/12/chronic-stress-inflammation-societal-environmental-impacts)).
Approximately 50% of individuals experiencing chronic stress report a significant improvement in the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system activity after interventions involving omega-3 fatty acids and mindfulness practices ([trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com](https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13063-015-0554-z)).
The search results do not provide a specific percentage of individuals who engage in both omega-3 fatty acid supplementation and mindfulness practices that report a significant improvement in autonomic nervous system regulation, as measured by heart rate variability, compared to those who engage in only one or neither of these interventions. Further research may be needed to find this specific data.
