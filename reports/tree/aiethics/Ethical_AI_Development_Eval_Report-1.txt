EVAL REPORT 
Answer Relevancy Score: 0.86
Answer Relevancy Info: The score is 0.86 because the majority of the output directly addresses the input question about ethical considerations in AI product development. The response thoroughly covers key ethical principles such as transparency, fairness, privacy, and accountability, which are central to the input.
