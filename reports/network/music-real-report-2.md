## Duration and Frequency of Sessions

The effectiveness of music therapy in treating depression is significantly influenced by the duration and frequency of the sessions. Research indicates that short to medium-term interventions, ranging from 1 to 4 months, are effective, with the number of sessions varying from 7 to 78. A meta-analysis found that medium-term music therapy (6–12 weeks) significantly improves depression symptoms. For older adults, sessions exceeding 60 minutes per week conducted by a music therapist are most effective. Improvisational music therapy, such as 20 bi-weekly sessions of 60 minutes each, has shown significant improvements in depression, anxiety, and general functioning. Additionally, a 6-week intervention combining improvisational music therapy with structured slow breathing has also been beneficial.

## Conclusion

Music therapy offers a valuable alternative or complementary treatment for individuals with depression. By engaging patients in musical activities, it addresses emotional, cognitive, and social needs, providing a holistic approach to mental health care. The mechanisms of anxiety reduction, reward circuit activation, and enhanced emotional regulation play crucial roles in alleviating depressive symptoms. Moreover, the duration and frequency of music therapy sessions are critical factors in determining its effectiveness. As research continues to evolve, music therapy holds promise for broader application in mental health treatment, offering a non-invasive and enjoyable therapeutic option.
